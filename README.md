My first blog on Blogger. I've been manually editing this HTML theme file since 2006 and never switched to the 'second generation layouts'. 

Never used a visual editor. Includes use cases of Blogger buil-in functions and other simple widgets: Google translate widget, search module...

I'm making this public because there is barely any documentation for the Blogger platform and some people might find some of the elements in my code helpful.
